      <h3>1969 Texas: A woman named Norma McCorvey wanted an abortion. At this time, abortion in Texas was legal -- but only if the woman's life was in danger. McCorvey unsuccessfully attempted to get an illegal abortion, so after that she received the help of Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington (Texas attorneys). McCorvey was given the pseudonym "Jane Roe." In 1970, they filed a lawsuit on behalf of Roe against Henry Wade (district attorney of Dallas County). Eventually, in 1973, the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide (however in the third trimester of pregnancy, the state could prohibit the abortion).</h3>

      <h3>On June 24th, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. What this means is that now the decision to prohibit or allow abortions will go to the states, rather than being federal law. Already, about 50% of states have either banned abortion or are planning to. Very few states, such as California, will be a safe haven for women looking to get an abortion. </h3>
